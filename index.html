			<div class="main">
				<p>I wasn't a very confident child. 
				</p>
				<p>
				My self-esteem would sop like a Siberian jelly, veering off the plate and into the delicious chalice of superiority complex entwined with my soul. I was heavily unadjusted for reality, feigning curiosity upon the unmet expetctations of my family; bleeding tar under the guise of industrial espionage. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Life wasn't difficult, so much that it was contrived. Growing up with a string of father figures ranging from the incompetent to the disorderly, all that was left to abhor was my mother - an irrational judgement of backhanded self-criticism and conditional hugs. You know, everything a growing a boy needs to cry.  
				</p>

				<p>
				In 2007, a traditional diet of rice and pasta is reinventing the definition of cellulite on my face. My hair is as greasy a mechanic's handshake and my eyes are barely attempting to persevere through the severe pornography addiction shaking my reality. I was just another kid with the expectations of an investment banker, pretending to do his best whilst utterly confused at the required paper pushing and gluttony.
				</p>
				<p>
				I wasn't a particularly dedicated or passionate student. All I really cared about was playing video games, delegating what little responsibility I had towards cultivating the teenage fantasy of cheap women wearing loose attitudes, a pinnacle for those too terrified to even look a girl in the eye. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from the creepy posterior and discarded euphoria, I hated absolutely everyone, including myself. I would spend each lunchtime in the library, hiding away from the world, feeding off the moisture manifesting from my avid self-deprivation. "The delicate hand of life is prying at my misery, burying memories at a haste not last seen since the Great Depression."
				</p>
				<p>
				Fortunately, years of self-hate and brooding would develop into a coping mechanism sparing me the pity of being visibly distressed, both physically and mentally: My ability to make people laugh. My humour, which was as dry as a sack of salt, would allow me to mask the inconsistency of my mood and behaviour, as a kind of quirk to be admired. I was even offered to become part of the jock and theatre groups following a string of particularly hilarious events, to which I arrogantly declined in dramatic fashion.
				</p>

				<p><span id="adelaidesucks"></span>I suppose my first attempt at media began with an online forum some kids in our year level had decided to propogate. It was very bootleg at the time. Naturally, as part of the ingrown tumor accommodating the seizure prone area of my brain, I thought it appropiate to create my own rival forum. Obviously, it would be better in every way. I'll spare you the details, however I ended up being suspended, with both treason and cyberbullying sighted as key reasons.</p>

				<p>So instead, to spare myself the future embarrassment of being a rampant liar, I decided to start a personal blog to note down my thoughts and feelings, entitled <a href="#adelaidesucks" title="adelaidesucks"><span class="b l">Adelaidesucks</span></a>. Why? Because there was a kid from Adelaide and like a pack of hyenas, made him feel like death's cousin for the privilege. If we had a shooting range, we woud have ended his life instead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite being a terrible writer with a mild case of dyslexia and an inability to descipher between past and present tense, it was a harmless activity which would spur my love for writing and humour.</p>

			<p>With no friends and an awkward attitude, pathetic on a level no one dares to admit, I had a habit of talking to myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			It was a way for me to keep the heart warm, and flood the soul with a temporary diaspora. Soon I decided to buy an audio recorder to keep the voices permanent. I would record zany shows, stupid voices aaaaaaand just about anything to remind myself that everything was perfectly fine, as I witnessed my brittle emotions crumble into a lonely pit of despair. </p>

			<p><span id="dottjt"></span>Though really, it gets a lot worse. To further validate my self-worth, I would create &lsquo;funny&rsquo; MySpace accounts, which I would then spam to random people, asking them for their opinions on whether they found it the most brilliantly hilarious thing they've ever read on earth. Complying with my demands, I would then proceed to feel amazing about myself, as I'm sure we've all desired at some point in our lives.
			</p>
			<p><span id="melbournesucks"></span><span id="sydneysucks"></span> <span id="hobartsucks"></span> <span id="perthsucks"></span>In 2008 I also experimented with video media for the first time, inspired by YouTube pop culture.

Even though it was an entirely unoriginal concept, it was the best my 15 year old brain could manage.</p>

			<p>I also continued blogging, creating <a href="#melbournesucks" title="MelbourneSucks"><span class="b l">MelbourneSucks</span></a>, <a href="#sydneysucks" title="SydneySucks"><span class="b l">SydneySucks</span></a>, <a href="#hobartsucks" title="HobartSucks"><span class="b l">HobartSucks</span></a> and <a href="#perthsucks" title="PerthSucks"><span class="b l">PerthSucks</span></a> and in fact, there was a blog for each Australian major city. Please don't ask why, it's just what kids do.</p>

		<li>Hosted my very first radio show at the age of sixteen. </li>

		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="justanothertopicalafternoon"></span> Eventually it dawned on me that babbling incoherently into a recorder simply wasn&rsquo;t enough. Listening to a lot of podcasts at the time (particularly Get This, featuring a young Ed Kavalee and The Spoonman on Triple M), I was particularly keen to become a radio professional, and so I applied for my very own radio show at SYN FM. </p>

			<p>Thankfully my application was approved and my very first radio show <a href="#justanothertopicalafternoon" title="Just Another Topical Afternoon"><span class="o l">Just Another Topical Afternoon</span></a> was born. Presenting with a friend from high school, I wrote and produced the whole thing, while he was assigned to turning up infrequently, often stoned, eventually not turning up at all. </p>

			<p>Aside from the visceral disagreements and choking fights with the station's general manager, I soon became obsessed with my amateur hobby, espousing bullshit for a pretty dime and an hour's worth of your time. After each show, I would quickly rush home to edit the studio recording, where I would sit and listen to the tape on repeat, hundreds upon hundreds of times. I thought it was magical.
			</p>

			<p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of producing radio is recieveing on-air texts from listeners. There was an on-going joke on the show that you could win a date with me, which soon became reality when a person offered their number. Later admitting "she" was suicidal, I freaked out, only to be told later that the person was actually an undercover cop doing research, having called the number to a man.
			</p>
			<p>
			More viably, I was the victim of a convincing prank. </p>

			<p> <span id="backhandfilms"></span> I didn't spend a lot of time creating things in my last year of high school, as I was too busy pretending to study, whilst actually playing Pokemon on my Nintendo DS. Following exams however, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do: I wanted to become the next big thing on YouTube. </p>
			<p>YouTube was beginning to gain traction as a platform and with the likes of mychonny and other self-obsessed personalities, I wanted to become something special. Collaborating with a friend from high school, we decided to make a YouTube channel called <a href="" title="Back Hand Films"><span class="r l">Back Hand Films</span></a>, which at one point features a young Julius Reade wearing a corset, whilst being teabagged. We created scripted videos and performed a lot of improv. </p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the outfit didn&rsquo;t work out. I didn&rsquo;t think he was funny and he thought I was too much of a control freak. In retrospect, I think we both realised that we were too individual to be able to work as a team. This not only ended our YouTube venture, however also our friendship. My dream was in ruins.  </p>

		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="thefaptacularonehourspecial"></span> <span id="crack"></span> Enrolled in a Bachelor of Journalism at Monash University, I would soon further my involvement in community radio to fulfil my self-worth, following the failure of my YouTube comedy ambitions. At one point, I was on four different radio networks at the same time.  </p>
			<p> <span id="wetalkyoudie"></span> At Radio Monash and 3SSR I partnered with my best friend at the time, presenting and producing <a href="#thefaptacularonehourspecial" title="The Faptacular One Hour Special"><span class="o l">The Faptactular One Hour Special</span></a> and <a href="#crack" title="CRACK"><span class="o l">CRACK</span></a> thinking it was going to be some kind of magical Hamish and Andy experience. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t. It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t really into the whole radio thing and that he was much more interested in doing music journalism, and so the duo was in tatters, as would be our friendship into the future. </p>
			<p> <span id="hiddencontroversy"></span> <span id="thehourlywage"></span> Hoping to regain some kind of common ground, we instead decided to start a website called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/we-talk-you-die/id448299058?mt=2" title="We Talk, You Die Podcast"><span class="p l">We Talk, You Die</span></a> which would feature both music and comedy articles and videos. Of course, the two didn&rsquo;t really mix and I didn't really see the point of comedy journalism, so I phased myself out.</p>
			<p> <span id="visionaustraliaradio"></span>SYN FM was a different story. Whilst producing my radio show, <a href="#hiddencontroversy" title="Hidden Controversy"></a><span class="o l">Hidden Controversy</span>, I met a future collaborator who I would later produce another show with entitle <a href="#thehourlywage" title="The Hourly Wage"><span class="o l">The Hourly Wage</span></a> which I announced and he panelled. I would continue to collaborate with him to produce and record a radio play I had written. After a successful initial recording, he bailed to produce his own series of podcasts and we stopped being friends. As you can tell, none of my collaborations ever seem to work out. </p>

			<p> <span id="thefinancialreality"></span> <span class="o l">Vision Australia Radio</span> was a different story. I would end up staying there for more than three years, responsible for reading articles for the bind. During my tenure I managed to produce and present more than 100 episodes of Don&rsquo;t Hold Back, a sort of youth radio show, which I arguably didn&rsquo;t enjoy but looked good on my resume. </p>

			<p>At the same time, I was getting pretty involved with economics and finance in my life. I simply found it fascinating. As a journalism hopeful, I was learning quite a lot about the corruption in finance, which lead to creating my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz6xG2YtyyE" title="The Financial Reality 2011"><span class="r l">The Financial Reality</span></a>. The channel aimed to explain complex financial issues in laymans terms. Following many sleepless nights, I eventually managed to produce a nine minute video explaining the global debt crisis, which to this day has more than 150,000 views. </p>
			<p>Please don&rsquo;t watch it. It makes me cringe like a piece of burnt plastic, wavering for mercy. </p>

		<li>Decided to give YouTube comedy another crack. </li>
		<li>Begun the Zero Hedge Daily Round Up podcast. </li>
		<li>Wrote terrible poetry whilst on drugs. </li>
	</ul>
	<div class="boxes b8">
		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="thezerohedgedailyroundup"></span>I had an idea for a podcast which I thought would be quite successful.</p>
			<p>
				As a self-confessed Zero Hedge fanatic (before it got hijacked), I thought there would be a media opportunity to summarise all the news items on the website, as well as provide my own take on them. The end result was <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-zero-hedge-daily-round-up/id494219092?mt=2" title="The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up"></a><span class="g l">The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up</span>, a six minute finance/comedy news bulletin that took 3 hours to produce each morning, each Tuesday to Saturday. I would wake up at 7am and finish at 10am. </p>
				
				<p>
				It ended up being highly successful, with more than 55,000 downloads in total. I was even featured as a regular contributor on Zero Hedge itself! Unfortunately, despite the success of my podcast, a large majority of the crowd disliked my humour and they thought it was immature. It was disheartening to think the community I had embraced thought I was a complete twat. </p>
				<p>
				Of course, there was a greater problem. My depression and mental illness issues were beginning to exacerbate and bring me down. All the pressure I had put on myself from my commitment, the failures of my past, including all the expectations of who I should be, weighed heavily on me.
				</p>
				<p><span id="drudgereportreport"></span> It meant I was never consistent. I would produce media for weeks at a time, only to crash and burn into a horrible pit of depression and self-worthlessness. My only response was to criticise myself further. I assumed that my feelings were due to a lack of effort, and so I would come back harder and stronger, only to crash and burn out more spectacularly each time. </p>
				<p>
				To try harder I created a second podcast in tandem entitled <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/drudge-report-report/id562831680?mt=2" title="Drudge Report Report"><span class="g l">Drudge Report Report</span></a> which was a similar concept, however targeted a much larger and more influential media outlet. While the popularity grew rapidly, I eventually crashed to a point of complete apathy, stopping media altogether. </p>
					<p><span class="thefinanicalreality2012/2013"></span>		
				While it seems stupid in retrospect, it was simply how I was raised as a child. It is something I picked up from my mother, through her constant judgment and criticism of every single thing about my personality. To move forward with my mental health, I would later proceed to disown her and cut off all contact completely. Certainly, my happiness and mental health has improved dramatically since then.
					</p>
					<p>
				On the YouTube front I decided to mix my two passions: finance and comedy. I would create these stupid little comedy videos for my financial YouTube channel, which I focused solely on creating once I had finished up the round up in October. This would last until mid-2013: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UfH_nmiNoXYSAUk8CVDPzoxYAAzkoGR" title=""></a><span class="r l">The Financial Reality 2012/2013</span>. I also decided to give YouTube comedy a second crack, which lasted four episodes until my mental health gave in.</p>
				
				<p><span id="juliusismyname"></span>It begs to say that I also spent a large portion of 2012 writing terrible, somewhat sexual poetry whilst being high on drugs. I distinctly remember recording a few episodes of the round up whilst tripping on LSD. I'd also travelled to France, England and China during the year.
					</p>

				<p>I also tried YouTube comedy again via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C75E66499028BB8" title="Juliusismyname YouTube channel"></a><span class="r l">Juliusismyname</span> which as you can imagine, didn't work out.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe mental illness, however I couldn&rsquo;t quite deal with the guilt and shame of burning out and disappearing for weeks at a time.
					</p>
					<p>
					I felt judged and vindicated and with the constant self-criticism, came the feeling of complete and utter failure. All those dead collaborations. All those friends lost, not to mention, the disaster that was university. Nothing in my life seemed to be working out, and so I stopped. I stopped producing media altogether. </p>

					<p>But rather than give up and let go of all the pain and misdirection, I did what any unknownly desperate person would do: chase one hopeless ambition for another. I decided to pursue a different goal instead: Women. Though really, like any chase in life, you did it for hope. The hope that something might turn out right in your life.
					</p>

					<p><span id="inkquotes"></span><span id="tktxtktx"></span>I knew zero women at the time (and arguably my entire life) and so I had to be inventive. I figured tumblr would be a good outlet, as it would be subtle as a non-dating website. Not to mention, the girls on tumblr were usually mentally ill as well and so I figure we&rsquo;d probably click. In addition, I could also write and have my writing appreciated, so it was kind of a win/win.</p>

					<p>This lead to my first blog <a href="inkquotes.tumblr.com" title="inkquotes tumblr blog"><span class="pur l">inkquotes</span></a>. Initially it was a bit of a disaster, however after one month of painstaking effort, I finally managed to kiss a girl and within two months, I secured my first girlfriend. I was over the moon like you cannot believe. I thought I'd died and went to heaven. I later created <a href="tktxtktx.tumblr.com" title="tktxtktx tumblr blog"><span class="pur l">tktxtktx</span></a> during our relationship.</p>
					<p>
					Of course, what they don&rsquo;t tell you is that it&rsquo;s a horrible idea to fall in love with someone else who is also mentally ill AND suicidal, so naturally the relationship broke down and my mental health collapsed. I overdosed on a variety of drugs and ended up in hospital.
					</p>
					<p>I thought maybe it would get her attention, or something. Who really knows.</p>

					<p>My depression got worse.</p>
					<p>
					I became more and more irrational, frequently trading one bad crowd for another. I was highly insecure and an emotional wreck at the best of times. I was frequentlysmoking weed and taking research chemicals without consequence. I didn&rsquo;t value myself and I would do anything women said.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I vividly remember breaking down at work. I was unpacking a pallet of various liquids and I remember picking up a bottle of gardening poison and thinking: "What possibly difference would it make if I just swallowed the whole thing right now?" It was a low point and the first and last suicidal thought I'd ever had.
					</p>
					<p><span id="sweetcherryerotica"></span><span id="blackwhiteinkcurvesxxx"></span><span id="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles"></span>
					I mean, what kind of a 21 year old hangings around 16 year old LADS in bad parts of town? Well, the internet, apparently. Drug dealers, arsonists and delinquents. I remember one kid named porky who was 15 and completely covered in tattoos. He got aggressive when I poked fun at his mother, however the confidence impressed him. Part of me was attracted to the danger. I thought maybe this is what it meant to be a journalist. </p>
					<p>The good news is that the insecurity, the drugs, the near death experiences, all made for incredibly interesting and brilliant writing. It helped fuel the content for my tumblr blogs, convincing women I was some kind of adventurous William S. Burroughs, my idol at the time. I would go on to create <a href="sweetcherryerotica.tumblr.com" title="sweetcherry erotica"><span class="pur l">sweetcherry erotica</span></a>,
					<a href="blackwhiteinkcurvesxxx.tumblr.com" title="blackwhiteinkcurves"><span class="pur l">blackwhiteinkcurves</span></a> and
					<a href="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles.tumblr.com" title="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles"><span class="pur l">brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles</span></a> writing in excess of 170,000 words.
				</p>
				<p>
				Of course,  I knew I couldn&rsquo;t continue this life of arbitrary mischievous forever. Following a string of bad women, I pledged to get off tumblr and instead focus solely on my mental health and break the cycle of my insecurity. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. I ended up trading one addiction for another, soon turning to gambling and pornography to ease my woes. </p>
				<p>
				When I left however, there was one girl I still wanted to keep in contact with. She&rsquo;d claimed to have already had a boyfriend when I last spoke to her, so I thought she might make a nice friend. So we added each other on Facebook and within 5 minutes, I instantly knew we would be in a relationship (it turns out she was single) and we&rsquo;ve been together ever since. </p>

				<p>To celebrate my love for her, I wrote her a small book for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a few hundred pages, packed full of drawings, cartoons, jokes and pictures. I took me way too long to make.  </p>

				<p>The rebound.</p>
				<p><span id="perspectivetheory"></span>
				Graduating at the end of 2014, I reluctantly began my venture into full-time work. Aside from my depression and mental health issues, there were also no journalism/writing jobs available for my experience. In addition, I was beginning to doubt the authenticity of journalism as a career.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, I had a plan. I was going to develop a writing portfolio so that by 2016, I could get a writing/journalism position. In the meantime, I would work full-time in various "offcut" positions to bathe myself in a wide variety of work experiences. That writing portfolio was to become <a href="perspectivetheory.com" title="Perspective Theory"><span class="p l">Perspective Theory</span></a>, a website to help those suffering from depression.</p>
				<p>
				As I&rsquo;d been actively working on my mental health over the years, I&rsquo;d read enough about perspective and self-awareness to understand how it worked. At the same time, I couldn't get it to consistently work, so I thought maybe if I were to write about it, I'd get better at managing my mental health. Ultimately, I ended up publishing more than 90,000 words, writing a hell of a lot more. </p>
				<p>My first job was as an <a href="http://www.prolearn.com.au/" title="Prolearn"></a><span class="y l">Education Consultant</span> at ProLearn selling TAFE education. It was one of the most horrendous experiences of my life. Put simply, the turnover was so bad that you would see 30 new faces each week. Half would be gone by the next day and you'd maybe have a handful left by the end of the week.
			</p>
			<p>
				The experience was so traumatic that it took me another two months before I could garner the courage to find another position, which lead me to discover a <a href="http://mcleodrail.com.au/" title="McLeod Rail"><span class="y l">Digital Marketing Specialist</span></a> position I was clearly unqualified for (I distinctly remember the MD shouting at me over my &laquo;&#160;terrible&#160;&raquo; email newsletter). </p>

				<p>Afterwards I discovered a <a href="http://www.ozwashroom.com.au/" title=""><span class="y l">Marketing Assistant</span></a> position at OzWashroom - an operation which claimed to be the second largest washroom supplier nationally. Of course, I managed to get fired after three weeks. </p>

				<p>You see, in preparing for marketing positions, I was required to learn a lot of HTML/CSS and web design. As a result, I virtually spent all my time learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, which I became virtually obsessed with. I would spend all my free time coding... particularly at work. Eventually I got caught out and I was accused of hacking into their system to steal, in their words, their "SEO" as I was put it.
				</p>

				<p><span id="elegantlyattached"></span>
				Now halfway through the year, I realised that I probably had enough experience to secure a proper writing position. Delivering a series of impressive interviews, I ended up as a Content Writer at Expotrade, a company responsible for a monopoly share of major project and transport infrastructure projects within the state. Actually, my title was immediately upgraded to a <a href="http://www.expotradeglobal.com/" title="Expotrade Global website"><span class="y l">PR &amp; Communications Executive</span></a>, which couldn&rsquo;t have sounded more impressive, at least on paper.</p>

				<p>
				I also prompted started another tumblr blog <a href="elegantlyattached.tumblr.com" title="elegantlyattached"></a><span class="pur l">elegantlyattached</span> before realising that a) already had a wonderful girlfriend and b) there were probably more important things I could do with my time.

				After much struggle I finally managed to get my mental health in order. I cut off all the toxic people in my life, including my own mother, and I managed to become mentally stable, which is weird. I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s inherently better, just more in line with my own goals. </p>

				<p>I don&rsquo;t take my emotions or episodes personally. I very seldom get burnt out despite working twice as hard as I ever have, and most importantly, I no longer feel riddled with guilt or shame about who I am. My mind is simply calm and focused. It&rsquo;s like my brain has been upgraded or something.</p>

				<p><span id="thefinanicalreality2015/2016"></span>One of the big worries of mental stability is thinking that your ambition and character will disappear. However, I can ascertain that it only gets strong. To actually have control over yourself is like being given a gun, over a spear; control to be as functioning or as mentally ill as you like, but control none-the-less.</p>

				<p>With my mental health in order, I decided to give YouTube comedy one last crack: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UfH_nmiNoUqZUvUVT3SclR8VLnT6Uss" title="The Financial Reality 2015/2016"><span class="r l">The Financial Reality 2015/2016</span></a> While it started out fine, soon evolved into pure hate and and incoherence, almost by design. Regardless, it wasn&rsquo;t contributing towards my mental health and so I stopped. Was it funny? I'm not sure.</p>

				<p>If I had to sum up everything I've done this year, I would say I spent a majority of this year studying code. </p>

					<p> I mainly want to continue my focus on code. I love code like you cannot imagine and it's been an absolute pleasure creating this website. I love data structures, algorithms, functional paradigms, you name it. I could talk about it for hours. I've mainly been focusing on HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Python, though I've messed around extensively with Clojure, Haskell, C and Java. I think I might take C# seriously.</p>

					<p>If you would like to take a look at some of my code, please check out my <a href="https://github.com/dottjt">Github account</a>. There's a lot of terrible, unfinished projects on there, but at least it can give you a sense of my coding style.</p>

					<p> I still write on my medium blog from time to time to express myself and continue playing with words.<a class="gr" href="https://medium.com/@JuliusReade"> @JuliusReade</a></p>
					
					<p>I&rsquo;m also currently in the process of developing a mental health guide, which is roughly 20,000 words through, though I&rsquo;ve probably written 80,000 words over various drafts, trying to conquer this thing. </p>
