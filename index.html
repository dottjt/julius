			<li>Developed my very first blog.</li>
			<li>Troublemaker and struggling academic.</li>
			<li>Suspended for treason and cyberbullying.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="boxes b2">
			
			<div class="main">
				<p>I was an unconfident child. 
				</p>
				<p>
				My self-esteem would sop like a Siberian jelly, veering off the plate and into the delicious chalice of superiority complex entwined with my soul. I was heavily unadjusted for reality, feigning curiosity upon the unmet expectations of my family; bleeding tar under the guise of industrial espionage. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Life wasn't difficult, so much that it was contrived. Growing up with a string of father figures ranging from the incompetent to the disorderly, all that was left to abhor was my mother - an irrational judgement of backhanded self-criticism and conditional hugs. You know, because empty tears should play an essential role in any growing boy's diet.  
				</p>

				<p>
				In 2007, a traditional diet of rice and pasta is reinventing the definition of cellulite on my face. My hair is as greasy a mechanic's handshake and my eyes are barely attempting to persevere through the severe pornography addiction shaking my reality. I was just another kid with the expectations of an investment banker, pretending to do his best whilst utterly chaotic in a jumbled mess of confusion and spontaneous hostility.
				</p>
				<p>
				I wasn't a particularly dedicated or passionate student. All I really cared about was playing video games, delegating what little responsibility I had towards cultivating the teenage fantasy of cheap women, draping what little promiscuity they have in the loose attitudes sweating from their busts; a pinnacle for those too terrified to even look a girl in the eye. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from the creepy posterior and discarded euphoria, I hated absolutely everyone, including myself. I would spend each lunchtime in the library, hiding away from the world, feeding off the moisture manifesting from my avid self-deprivation. "The delicate hand of life is prying at my misery, burying memories at a haste not last seen since the Great Depression."
				</p>
				<p>
				Fortunately, years of self-hate and brooding would develop into a coping mechanism sparing me the pity of my visible distress, both physically and mentally: My ability to make people laugh. My humour, which was as dry as crushed oregano, would allow me to mask the inconsistency of my mood and behaviour, as a kind of quirk to be admired. I was even offered to become part of the jock and theatre groups following a string of particularly hilarious events, to which I arrogantly declined in dramatic fashion.
				</p>

				<p><span id="adelaidesucks"></span>I suppose my first attempt at media began with an online forum some kids in our year level had decided to propagate. It was very bootleg at the time, causing mischief for those who desired it. Naturally, as part of the ingrown tumor accommodating the seizure prone area of my brain, I thought it appropriate to create my own rival forum. Obviously, it would be bigger and better in every way, cultivating pride with grant hysteria. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I'll spare you the details, however I ended up being suspended, with both treason and cyberbullying sighted as key reasons.</p>

				<p>So instead, to spare myself the future embarrassment of being a rampant liar, I decided to start a personal blog to note down my thoughts and feelings, entitled <a href="#adelaidesucks" title="adelaidesucks"><span class="b l">Adelaidesucks</span></a>. Why? Because there was a kid from Adelaide and like a pack of hyenas, felt obliged to make him feel death for it. If we had a shooting range, we would have crippled instead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite being a terrible writer with a mild case of dyslexia and an inability to decipher between past and present tense, it was a harmless activity which would spur my love for writing and humour.</p>

			<p>With no friends and an awkward attitude, bordering on a kind of ritual patheticism no one ever dare admit, I managed to develop a habit of talking to myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			It was a way for me to keep the heart warm and flood the soul with a temporary diaspora, keeping what little hope I had in the teenage dream alive. Then next step, obviously, was to buy an audio recorder to keep the voices permanent. I would record zany shows, stupid voices aaaaaaand just about anything to remind myself that everything was perfectly fine, in-spite of the violation and atrophy lurking around the corner. </p>

			<p><span id="dottjt"></span>Though really, it gets a lot worse. To further validate my self-worth, I would create &lsquo;funny&rsquo; MySpace accounts, spamming random people to provide their opinions on whether they found it the most brilliantly hilarious thing they've ever read on earth. Often reinforcing my delusions of grandeur, I would then proceed to feel amazing about myself, as I'm sure we've all desired at some point in our lives.
			</p>
			<p><span id="melbournesucks"></span><span id="sydneysucks"></span> <span id="hobartsucks"></span> <span id="perthsucks"></span>In 2008 I also experimented with video media for the first time, inspired by YouTube pop culture. I decided to create a somewhat unoriginal video game/music video compilation for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDNnr9xMHQ6hJHp6NKKPY5Q" title="dottjt YouTube channel"><span class="r l">dottjt</span></a> my very first YouTube channel. The video was a montage of Super Smash Brothers' footage to the song "Smack That" by Akon. Truly, it was the best my 15 year old brain could manage.</p>

			<p>I also continued blogging, creating <a href="#melbournesucks" title="MelbourneSucks"><span class="b l">MelbourneSucks</span></a>, <a href="#sydneysucks" title="SydneySucks"><span class="b l">SydneySucks</span></a>, <a href="#hobartsucks" title="HobartSucks"><span class="b l">HobartSucks</span></a> and <a href="#perthsucks" title="PerthSucks"><span class="b l">PerthSucks</span></a> and in fact, an appropriately entitled blog for each Australian major city. Please don't ask why, it's just what kids do.</p>

		<li>Hosted my very first radio show at the age of sixteen.</li>

		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="justanothertopicalafternoon"></span> Eventually it dawned on me that babbling incoherently into a recorder simply wasn&rsquo;t enough. Listening to a lot of podcasts at the time (particularly Get This, featuring a young Ed Kavalee and The Spoonman on Triple M), I was keen to become a radio professional, and so I applied for a radio show at SYN FM. </p>

			<p>Thankfully my application was approved and my very first radio show <a href="#justanothertopicalafternoon" title="Just Another Topical Afternoon"><span class="o l">Just Another Topical Afternoon</span></a> was born. Presenting with a friend from high school, I wrote and produced the whole thing, while he was blessed with turning up infrequently, often stoned, eventually not turning up at all. </p>

			<p>Aside from the visceral disagreements and choking fights I had with the station's general manager, I soon became obsessed with my amateur hobby, espousing bullshit for a pretty dime. After each show, I would quickly rush home to edit the studio recording, to which I would sit and listen on repeat, thinking it was the most magical thing. Hundreds, upon hundreds of times. 
			</p>

			<p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of producing radio was recieving on-air texts from listeners. There was an on-going joke on the show that you could win a date with me, which wasn't actually a joke, but a desperate ploy for a sexually hookup. Eventually, someone bit. Later admitting "she" was suicidal, I freaked out, only to be told that this suicidal teenager was actually an undercover cop doing research, having called the number to the voice of a man in an office.
			</p>
			<p>
			More viably, I was the victim of a convincing prank, though would certainly not be the last I used my media talents to try and attract women. </p>

			<p> <span id="backhandfilms"></span> I didn't spend a lot of time creating things in my last year of high school, as I was too busy pretending to study, whilst actually playing Pokemon on my Nintendo DS. Following exams however, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do: I wanted to become the next big thing on YouTube. </p>

			<p>YouTube was beginning to gain traction as a platform and with the likes of mychonny and other self-obsessed personalities, I wanted to make others laugh. Collaborating with a entirely different, and more sober friend from high school, we decided to create a YouTube channel entitled <a href="" title="Back Hand Films"><span class="r l">Back Hand Films</span></a>, which at one point features a young Julius Reade wearing a corset, whilst being tea-bagged like a wet fish. We created videos and performed improv. </p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, the outfit wasn&rsquo;t destined to work out. I didn&rsquo;t think he was funny and he thought I was too much of a control freak. This not only ended our YouTube venture, however also our somewhat incompatible friendship. My dream was in ruins.  </p>

		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="thefaptacularonehourspecial"></span> <span id="crack"></span> Enrolled in a Bachelor of Journalism at Monash University, I would soon further my involvement in community radio to fulfil my self-worth, following the failure of my YouTube comedy ambitions. At one point, I was on four different radio networks at the same time, extorting my pride like a crack pipe connected deep into the manic depression I thought candour.  </p>

			<p> <span id="wetalkyoudie"></span> At Radio Monash and 3SSR I partnered with my best friend at the time, presenting and producing <a href="#thefaptacularonehourspecial" title="The Faptacular One Hour Special"><span class="o l">The Faptactular One Hour Special</span></a> and <a href="#crack" title="CRACK"><span class="o l">CRACK</span></a> thinking it was going to be some kind of magical Hamish and Andy experience. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t. It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t really into the whole radio thing and with a wistful haste, the duo was in tatters. </p>

			<p> <span id="hiddencontroversy"></span> <span id="thehourlywage"></span> Hoping to regain some kind of common ground, we instead decided to start a website called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/we-talk-you-die/id448299058?mt=2" title="We Talk, You Die Podcast"><span class="p l">We Talk, You Die</span></a> which would feature both music and comedy articles and videos. Of course, the two didn&rsquo;t really mix and as my cynicism for journalism grew, so did my involvement wane, eventually phasing myself out entirely altogether.</p>

			<p> <span id="visionaustraliaradio"></span>SYN FM was a different story. Whilst producing my radio show, <a href="#hiddencontroversy" title="Hidden Controversy"></a><span class="o l">Hidden Controversy</span>, I met a future collaborator who I would later produce another show with entitled <a href="#thehourlywage" title="The Hourly Wage"><span class="o l">The Hourly Wage</span></a> which I announced and he panelled. I would continue to collaborate with him to produce and record a radio play I had written, which after one successful initial recording, would proceed to bail on my project and produce his own series of podcasts. Naturally, we stopped being friends. </p>
			<p>
			As you can tell, none of my collaborations work out. </p>

			<p> <span id="thefinancialreality"></span> <span class="o l">At the same time, I was also volunteering at Vision Australia Radio</span> to read articles and produce a youth radio show entitled Don't Hold Back. I would end up staying there for more than three years, producing and presenting more than 100 episodes of Don&rsquo;t Hold Back. Of course, not that I enjoyed the experience. It simply looked good on my resume. </p>

			<p>In 2011 I was also getting pretty involved with economics and finance. I found topics fascinating beyond belief and as a journalism hopeful, was learning quite a lot about the corruption in finance. This lead to me creating my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz6xG2YtyyE" title="The Financial Reality 2011"><span class="r l">The Financial Reality</span></a> which would aim to explain complex financial issues in layman's terms. Following many sleepless nights, I eventually managed to produce a nine minute video explaining the global debt crisis, which to this day has more than 150,000 views. </p>
			<p>Please don&rsquo;t watch it. It makes me cringe like a piece of burnt plastic, waving for mercy. </p>

		<li>Decided to give YouTube comedy another crack, unsuccessfully. </li>
		<li>Continued finance involvement via the Zero Hedge Daily Round Up podcast. </li>
		<li>Begun the Drudge Drudge Report podcast.</li>
		<li>Wrote terrible poetry whilst on drugs. </li>
	</ul>
	<div class="boxes b8">
		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="thezerohedgedailyroundup"></span>Early in the year I had an idea for a podcast which I thought would be quite successful.</p>
			<p>
			As a self-confessed Zero Hedge fanatic (before it lost the plot), I thought there would be a media opportunity to summarise all the news items on the website, as well as provide my own take on them. The end result was <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-zero-hedge-daily-round-up/id494219092?mt=2" title="The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up"></a><span class="g l">The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up</span>, a six minute finance/comedy news bulletin that took three hours to produce each Tuesday to Saturday. I would wake up at 7:00am and have the podcast finished at 10:00am, just in time for New York audiences. </p>
				
				<p>
				It ended up being highly successful, with more than 55,000 downloads in total. I was even featured as a regular contributor on the Zero Hedge website itself! Unfortunately, despite the success of my podcast, the Zero Hedge crowd disliked my humour and ousted me as a clown. It was disheartening to think the community I'd embraced thought I was a complete twat, so I stopped producing the podcast in late October.</p>
				<p>
				Of course, there was a greater problem. My depression and mental health issues were beginning to exacerbate and take hold of my life. All the pressure I had put myself under of becoming a success, weighed by the failures of my past, were beginning to tear into the fabric of my self-perception. I simply couldn't keep up with my own demands.
				</p>
				<p><span id="drudgereportreport"></span> I stopped being consistent with my media. I would produce for weeks at a time, only to crash and burn into a horrible pit of agony and self-worthlessness. I would criticise myself, blaming my failure on my inability to just. be. better. In my arrogant stupor, I assumed my failure and worthless was due to not trying hard enough, which would prompt an even stronger response, only to crash and burn out more spectacularly each time. </p>
				<p><span class="thefinanicalreality2012/2013"></span>	
				One of these responses was to create a second podcast in tandem with my existing podcast entitled <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/drudge-report-report/id562831680?mt=2" title="Drudge Report Report"><span class="g l">Drudge Report Report</span></a> which was a similar concept, however targeted at a much larger and more influential media outlet, which rapidly grew in popularity.</p>
					<p>
				On the YouTube front I decided to mix my two passions: finance and comedy which would last from late-2012 to mid-2013: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UfH_nmiNoXYSAUk8CVDPzoxYAAzkoGR" title=""></a><span class="r l">The Financial Reality 2012/2013</span>. I was rewatching a video earlier and my gosh, I don't think I could have been more offended within the first ten seconds if I'd tried.
				
				<p><span id="juliusismyname"></span>A large portion of 2012 was also spent writing terrible, somewhat sexual poetry whilst being high on drugs. I distinctly remember recording a few episodes of the round up whilst tripping on LSD. I'd also travelled to France, England and China during the year.
					</p>

				<p>I also dedcided to give YouTube comedy again another chance via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C75E66499028BB8" title="Juliusismyname YouTube channel"></a><span class="r l">Juliusismyname</span>.

				<li>The passionless husk of my depression begins to bloom.</li>

				<p>
				Then one day I just stopped. </p>
					
				<p>
				I stopped producing media altogether and gave up my ambitions of becoming the next big thing on YouTube or iTunes or anywhere. My mental health had gotten the best of me and I was entirely broken and distraught, wanting nothing more than to fade away and pretend that the whole experience was just one big forgettable dream in a world far, far away.
				</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe mental illness, however I couldn&rsquo;t quite deal with the guilt and shame of burning out and disappearing for weeks at a time.
					</p>
					<p>
					I felt judged and vindicated, as if I were a complete and utter failure. All those broken collaborations and friends lost. Not to mention, the disaster that was university; a sopping failure of poor grades and pointless intuition. Nothing in my life seemed to be working out, and so I stopped. I felt as if I had no reason to continue.</p>

						<p>	
					It also might help to understand what it's like growing up with an Asian mother. You see, Asian mothers don't provide positive reinforcement. Instead, what they do is judge and criticise you as a form of motivation, pointing out the things you did wrong, rather than what you did right. Ultimately, it creates a pessimistic mindset where you only ever focus on the things you do wrong. A recipe for disaster.
					</p>


					<p>But rather than truly give up and let go of all the pain and misdirection, I did what any unknowningly desperate person would do: chase one hopeless ambition for another, like a gambling addict chuffing down on a cigarette to mitigate the loses from a previous night's shuffle. </p>

					<p>
					I decided to pursue women.
					</p>

					<p><span id="inkquotes"></span><span id="tktxtktx"></span>Of course, I knew absoutely nothing about women, nor any women themselves, which meant I had to be creative. This would lead to Tumblr. 
					</p>
					<p>
					I thought Tumblr would be a good outlet for a number of reasons. For starters, it wasn't a dating website, so it would subtle. Not to mention, the girls on Tumblr were usually mentally ill and as someone who also had problems of their own, thought it might work out. In addition, the way I would attract would would be via my writing and so I would have an expressive outlet, as well as an audience. Brilliant, I thought.  </p>

					<p>This lead to my first blog <a href="inkquotes.tumblr.com" title="inkquotes tumblr blog"><span class="pur l">inkquotes</span></a>. The idea was that I would handwrite quotes and girls would find them pretty. Initially, it was a bit of a disaster, however after one month of painstaking effort, I finally managed to hookup and within two months, secured my first girlfriend. I was over the moon like you cannot believe, later creating <a href="tktxtktx.tumblr.com" title="tktxtktx tumblr blog"><span class="pur l">tktxtktx</span></a> during our short relationship.</p>
					<p>
					Of course, what they don&rsquo;t tell you about love is that it&rsquo;s a horrible idea to become attached to someone who is not only mentally ill, but also suicidal, so naturally the relationship broke down and my mental health collapsed like a stack of cards. 
					</p>
					<p>Eventually, I overdosed. I distinctly remember screaming in the middle of the street as the heavy rain pierced through my skull, with the pleasure of the entire neighbourhood to watch me entrapped in a psychotic comatose. As the police approached me with their guns held firmly, I begged for them to shoot. Thankfully they took me to the hospital instead, with my arm damaged from trying to punch in a glass door. I honestly wonder how I've still managed to maintain a clean criminal record. </p>
					<p>

					I thought maybe it would get her attention, or something. Who really knows why we do the things we do. Sometimes we just want to feel loved.</p>

					<p>I think I'm crying.</p>

					<p>It's unfortunate to think that my depression would get worse before it would get better.</p>
					<p>
					I became more and more irrational as the drugs flowed like dry ice through my system, frequently trading one bad crowd for another. Highly insecure and emotionally blunt, I was taking more research chemicals than the factory could produce. I was like a ragdoll with a string: all you had to do was find the chord and pull.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I vividly remember breaking down at work. I was unpacking a pallet of various gardening products and I remember staring into a bottle of poison and thinking: "What possible difference would it make if I just swallowed the whole thing, right now?" It was arguably the first and last suicidal thought I would ever have.
					</p>
					<p><span id="sweetcherryerotica"></span><span id="blackwhiteinkcurvesxxx"></span><span id="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles"></span>
					I mean, what kind of a 21 year old hangs around a bunch 16 year old LADS in a bad part of town? Well, the internet, apparently. Drug dealers, arsonists and delinquents. I remember one kid, Porky, who was 15 and completely covered in tattoos. Lebo. Crompty. Unfortunately, also Kerser playing in the background.</p>
					
					<p>
					I think what made me stand out was my blatant naivety towards danger. I would insult people in ways that should have prompted a severe beating, only to be admired for the confidence. In one case I was absolutely pinging off my head and there was an individual who was a juvenile criminal. It's like his arms lived at the gym. So I went up to him and asked if I could shake his hand, as he smoked his cigarette around his mistresses. He reluctantly looked up and took the offer, to which I replied: "Now you can't staunch me." His face absolutely snapped.

					<p>
					I thought maybe this is what it meant to be a journalist. The prerequisite danger. The shady characters. I guess I just wanted to feel special.</p>

					<p>The good news is that the insecurity, the drugs and the near death experiences all made for incredibly interesting and brilliant writing. It helped fuel the content for my tumblr blogs, convincing women I was some kind of adventurous William S. Burroughs. I would go on to create <a href="sweetcherryerotica.tumblr.com" title="sweetcherry erotica"><span class="pur l">sweetcherry erotica</span></a>,
					<a href="blackwhiteinkcurvesxxx.tumblr.com" title="blackwhiteinkcurves"><span class="pur l">blackwhiteinkcurves</span></a> and
					<a href="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles.tumblr.com" title="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles"><span class="pur l">brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles</span></a> writing in excess of 170,000 words.
				</p>
				<p>
				Of course, the glamour ends there and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t continue this life of arbitrary self-destruction. Following a string of bad women, I pledged to get off tumblr and instead focus solely on my mental health instead. Though it wasn't easy and I ended up trading one addiction for another, soon turning to gambling and other false hopes to ease my woes. </p>
				<p>
				When I left however, there was one girl I still wanted to keep in contact with. She&rsquo;d claimed to have already had a boyfriend when, so I thought she wouldn't be a trigger and could just be my friend. So we added each other on Facebook and within 5 minutes, knew it was going to be a relationship (it turns out she was single) and we&rsquo;ve been together ever since. </p>

				<p>To celebrate my love for her, I wrote her a small book as a Christmas present. It&rsquo;s a few hundred pages, packed full of drawings, cartoons, jokes and pictures from our relationship. Oh, they joys of college unemployment.  </p>

				Graduating by the end of 2014, I reluctantly began my venture into full-time work. Aside from the leering mental health issues, there were also no journalism/writing jobs available for my utter lack of experience. In addition, I was beginning to doubt the authenticity of journalism as a career.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, I had a plan. I was going to develop a writing portfolio so that by 2016, I could get a writing/journalism position. In the meantime, I would work full-time in various "off-cut" positions to get some experience in other areas. That writing portfolio was to become <a href="perspectivetheory.com" title="Perspective Theory"><span class="p l">Perspective Theory</span></a>, a website to help those suffering from depression, which would lead to me publishing more than 90,000 words.</p>
				<p>
				As I&rsquo;d been actively working on my mental health over the years, I&rsquo;d read enough about perspective and self-awareness to understand that my mind wasn't right. At the same time, no matter how hard I tried, none of this self-awareness mumbo-jumbo would ever work (I now realise it's because it's a process that takes years) so I thought maybe if wrote about it, I could internalise my knowledge. 
				<p>
				Did it work? Who knows, but I'm certainly a lot better now and it was something that would help me with my career. </p>
				<p>My first job was as an <a href="http://www.prolearn.com.au/" title="Prolearn"></a><span class="y l">Education Consultant</span> at ProLearn selling TAFE education. Arguably, it was one of the most horrendous experiences of my life. Put simply, the turnover was so bad that you would see 30 new faces each week, to which Hhlf would be gone by the next day, with one or two people left by the end of the week. It was worse than a cult.
			</p>
			<p>
				The experience was so traumatic that it took me another two months before I would garner the courage to find another position, which lead me to becoming a <a href="http://mcleodrail.com.au/" title="McLeod Rail"><span class="y l">Digital Marketing Specialist</span></a> at McLeod Rail, which I was clearly unqualified for (I distinctly remember the MD shouting at me over my &laquo;&#160;terrible&#160;&raquo; email newsletter). </p>

				<p>Afterwards I discovered a <a href="http://www.ozwashroom.com.au/" title=""><span class="y l">Marketing Assistant and Administration</span></a> position at OzWashroom - a small operation which claimed to be the second largest washroom supplier nationally. Of course, I managed to get fired after three weeks. </p>

				<p>You see, in preparing for marketing positions, I was required to learn a lot of HTML/CSS and web design. As a result, I virtually spent all my time learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, which I became obsessed. I absolutely loved it. So I would spend all my free time coding... particularly at work. Eventually I got caught out, being accused of hacking into their system to steal, in their words, "SEO" as I was put it.
				</p>

				<p><span id="elegantlyattached"></span>
				Now halfway through the year, I realised that I probably had enough writing experience to secure a sufficient writing position. Delivering a series of impressive interviews, I ended up as a Content Writer at Expotrade, a company responsible for producing major project and transport infrastructure projects. Extrodinarily, my title was immediately upgraded to <a href="http://www.expotradeglobal.com/" title="Expotrade Global website"><span class="y l">PR &amp; Communications Executive</span></a>, which sounded hella' good on paper.</p>

				<p>
				I also prompted to start another tumblr blog <a href="elegantlyattached.tumblr.com" title="elegantlyattached"></a><span class="pur l">elegantlyattached</span> before realising that a) already had a wonderful girlfriend and b) there were were pressing things to do aka establish my career.

				After much struggle I finally managed to get my mental health in order. I cut off all the toxic people in my life, including my own mother, and I managed to become mentally stable, which I still find weird to this day. I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s inherently better, just more in line with my own goals. </p>

				<p>I don&rsquo;t take my emotions or episodes personally. I very seldom get burnt out despite working twice as hard as I ever have, and most importantly, I no longer feel riddled with guilt or shame about who I am. My mind is simply calm and focused, honed on destroying the earth with my capitalism greed. It&rsquo;s like my brain has been upgraded or something.</p>

				<p><span id="thefinanicalreality2015/2016"></span>One of the big worries of mental stability is thinking that your ambition and character will disappear. However, I can ascertain that it only gets strong. To actually have control over yourself is like being handed a gun, over a spear; the control to be as functioning or as mentally ill as you like. Trust me, it's a lot harder to kill yourself with a spear.</p>

				<p>With my mental health in order, I decided to give YouTube comedy one last crack: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UfH_nmiNoUqZUvUVT3SclR8VLnT6Uss" title="The Financial Reality 2015/2016"><span class="r l">The Financial Reality 2015/2016</span></a> While it started out fine, soon evolved into a reality of hate and incoherence. Was it funny? I'm not sure, but I certainly knew it wasn't positive, so I stopped.</p>
				<p>
				Expotrade, you have been lovely. While it wasn't the most interesting job at the best of times, it was an opportunity that I otherwise would never have dreamed of, and so thank you. 
				</p>

				<p>Though if I had to sum up 2016, I would say that I spent a majority of it studying code. UNIX. Algorithms. JavaScript. WebGL.</p>

					<p> I mainly want to continue my focus on code. I love code like you cannot imagine and it's been an absolute pleasure creating this website. I love data structures, algorithms, functional paradigms, you name it. I could talk about it for hours.
