			I don’t get it. I mean, it’s like my head is raging, or something. In my skull is this brittle imagination that veers into dysfunction, as if designed to tear into my validity and grind against the clouding inertia. It holds me relentlessly, cradling me into a lull diaspora; a cultural reminder of my own fatal imperfection, tricking me into fashionable atrophy.

			I guess, figuratively speaking, if you were to quiet the mind and empty your thoughts, life may approach a sharp minimum. Instead of running circles around your squares, you may instead, develop a sense of concentration and even utilise your talents to enhance reality, rather than pick at the toxic scraps of shitty relationships and grand delusions littering your mind. I mean, no one wants to be dragged against the ground, kicking and screaming as your fate decides the cumbersome tatter to your path, but that’s just the soup of the day.

Savoury lemons, tarty goodness; lustful hand-processed kale, strung so thick around my tubes it suffocates the wobble pertaining my vague neurological paralysis. I’m starving.”

			So here I am. A vulnerable, emotional wreck of a fried egg, saddled with guilt so deep it penetrates my consciousness and permeates into description of food, reminding me of my failure as a human being. If only I were a transgender jellyfish, floating with a kick of flirt. The good news is that I also highly motivated and effective human being, bent destroying the world with my ability to string words into sentences, because that’s just what my fingers do. I am not a right
