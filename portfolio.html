			Rather than present gloss as a primary colour, I thought I’d be interesting to provide an introspective into my life story as a creator. Achievements aside, flashy figures and billion dollar predictions can only hope to avoid the finer context of what we’re actually looking for.

			I’ve been writing and creating media since I was 14 years old, and so I would like to think it’s an integral part of who I am. Today, it is an aspect of my personality I would like to share with you.

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Developed my very first blog, Adelaidesucks.</li>
	<li>Slight troublemaker and poor academic.</li>
	<li>Failed at rivaliing a school forum.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b2">
		
		<div class="main">
		<p>This is where my journey begins.</p> 

		<p>
		Despite passing the Melbourne High School entrance exam, I couldn&rsquo;t have been more ill-defined for academia. Ranked 278 of 330 students in a hacked list leaked to students, the whole charade was much less interesting than my own misery. Not that I wasn&rsquo;t smart or anything, I just wasn&rsquo;t a particularly dedicated or passionate student. Ultimately, high school was a miserable experience and I had a superiority complex so thick you could cut it with a knife, draining the tar for suitable industrial production. Hate and cynicism were my younger cousins. </p>

		<p>Whilst my peers recognised my talent and humour, having been invited to become part of the jock and a theatre groups, I more-or-less hated everyone and declined any involvement outside of music, which was a parental obligation, rather than a pleasure. Welcome to the life of an Asian teenager. Rather, I would spend each lunchtime in the library, hiding away from the world, feeding off the moisture from my petrification. </p>

		<p>I suppose my first attempt at media began with an online forum some kids had decided to create for our year level. It was very bootleg. Naturally, the response was to create a rival forum, which would obviously be bigger and better in every way. Unfortunately, things didn&rsquo;t turn out as planned. Aside from the fact that no one used it, I was also caught posting a completely defamatory post about the founder of the other forum, which prompted a meeting with the year level coordinator. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been so awkward if my display picture weren&rsquo;t an animated gif of Mario humping Princess Peach as she shouted &laquo;&#160;1-UP&#160;&raquo; . I was suspended within my first few months of academia.</p>

		<p>Following my attempt at treason, I decided to start a blog as I thought it would be an appropriate outlet for my thoughts. As there was kid from Adelaide in our year level, whom everyone felt obliged to hate simply for the fact that he was from Adelaide (the guy from New Zealand got it worse) I decided to call the blog adelaidesucks. Even though I was a terrible writer, with a mild case of dyslexia and who would often could not decipher the difference between past and present tense, it was something I enjoyed greatly. I largely wrote comedy, which was my predominant talent at the time.  </p>

<div class="year">2008</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Successful Myspace spam career.</li>
	<li>Developed a habit of recording myself.</li>
	<li>My second blog, Melbournesucks, is created.</li>
	<li>My first venture into YouTube, producing video game compilations.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b3">
		<div class="main">
		<p>As a lonely child with no friends, I had a habit of talking to myself. I would just talk to myself for hours upon hours, so much so that I decided to buy an audio recorder so that I could record my voice and listen back to it. I would record zany shows, stupid voices aaaaaaand just about anything to remind me that everything. is. okay. </p>

		<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t really cover the extent of my desperation. To further validate my self-worth, I used to do this thing over the summer that I&rsquo;m sure was secretly a Masters of Nigerian scamming in disguise. I would create &lsquo;funny&rsquo; MySpace accounts which would entail a funny introduction paragraph, designed to make any idiot laugh. I would then spam my profile to people and ask them what they thought of my humour, expecting them to say it was the funniest thing they had ever read. A deep state Military Industrial Complex for the soul. Eventually the account would be flagged for spamming and the messages would no longer go through, whereby you&rsquo;d have to create a new account. In total you could get a few hundred messages per account. </p>

		<p>I also experimented with video media for the first time. Inspired by YouTube video game compilation pop culture, I decided to create a music videos of video game footage. In my first video, I created a montage of Super Smash Brothers to Akon&rsquo;s smash hit Smack That. I made a few others, however they weren&rsquo;t very good, despite the ambition. </p>

		<p>Continuing on from my Adelaidesucks blog, I then created Melbournesucks to continue my foray into writing.  </p>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>My very first radio show, Just Another Topical Afternoon on SYN FM. </li>
	<li>Became obsessed with podcasting. </li>
	<li>My third and final blog, Sydneysucks, is created. </li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b4">
		<div class="main">
		<p>With an ego the size of a bleeding haemorrhage, it dawned on me that babbling incoherently into a recorder simply wasn&rsquo;t enough. I wanted to do more with my personality and so I decided to sign up for a show at SYN FM. I used to listen to a lot of podcasts (particularly Get This, featuring a young Ed Kavalee and the Spoonman on Triple M) and was keen to become a radio professional. I was sixteen years old. </p>

		<p>Thankfully, my application went through and I was to host my very first show, Just Another Topical Afternoon, whom I would present with another friend from High School. Basically, I wrote and produced the whole thing and my friend was responsible for turning up infrequently, often stoned, eventually transitioning to not turning up altogether. </p>

		<p>I was obsessed with radio like you cannot believe. After each show, I would quickly rush home to edit the studio recording and I would sit there on my desk and listen to the show on repeat. Hundreds upon hundreds of times. It was magical. </p>

		<p>Perhaps the most exciting part of the on-air feedback you would get from listeners via texts. Sometimes hilarious. Other times, somewhat disturbing. I had an on going joke on the show that you could win a date with me (I was desperate and horny, as are all children at single-sex school). One person offered their number and we started casually texting. Things turned from good to worse when &laquo;&#160;she&#160;&raquo; admitted she was suicidal, only to later be texted that it was actually an undercover cop doing research. More viably, I was certain I was pranked. </p>

		<p>I also continued writing for my blogs, creating Sydneysucks - my last and final pursuit into high school blogging. Actually, I ended up creating a blog for each major Australian city, however I don&rsquo;t think they were particularly influential or special.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I spent a lot of time creating things in my last year of high school, as I was probably too busy pretending to study, whilst actually secretly playing Pokemon Diamond on my Nintendo DS. Well, that and doing stupid voices to myself. Following my exams however, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do: I wanted to become a YouTube star. </p>

		<p>YouTube was beginning to gain traction as a platform and with the likes of mychonny and other self-obsessed personalities, I wanted to become a household name. Collaborating with a friend from high school, we decided to make a YouTube Channel called BackHand Films, which was as racist and sexist as it sounds. We created scripted videos, as well as a lot of improv. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the outfit didn&rsquo;t work out. I didn&rsquo;t think he was funny and he thought I was too much of a control freak. In retrospect, I think we both realised that we were too individual to be able to work as a team, with both of us wanted to be leaders in our own realm, rather than collaborate. This not only ended our YouTube venture, however also our friendship. My dream was in ruins.  </p>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>University Radio at 3SSR, Radio Monash.</li>
	<li>Community Radio at Vision Australia Radio. </li>
	<li>SYN FM, Hidden Controversy, The Hourly Wage. </li>
	<li>Started We Talk, You Die written and audio content. </li>

</ul>

	<div class="boxes b7">
		<div class="main">
		<p>Following the tragedy of my YouTube comedy ambitions, I decided to turn to radio to fulfil my self-worth. Enrolled in a Bachelor of Journalism at Monash University, I would soon further my involvement in community radio. At one point, I was on four different radio networks at the same time - SYN FM, Radio Monash, 3SSR and Vision Australia Radio. </p>

		<p>At Radio Monash and 3SSR I partnered with my best friend at the time, thinking it was going to be some kind of magical Hamish and Andy experience. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t. It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t really into the whole radio thing and that he was much more interested in doing music journalism, and so the duo was in tatters, as would be our friendship into the future. </p>

		<p>Hoping to regain some kind of common ground, we instead decided to start a website called We Talk, You Die (well, it was largely his doing) which would feature both music and comedy articles and videos. Of course, the two didn&rsquo;t really mix and so I decided to phase out my involvement with the whole thing. Eventually, it ended up to become a successful indie music website, though we no longer speak. </p>

		<p>SYN FM was a different story. Whilst producing my show, Hidden Controversy, I met a future collaborator who I would later produce another show with, The Hourly Wage, which I announced and he panelled. Having also written a radio play later in the year, I would collaborate with him to produce and record the production. After a successful initial recording, he basically bailed to produce his own series of podcasts. As you can tell, none of my collaborations ever seem to work out. </p>

		<p>Vision Australia Radio was a different story. It was a radio station of the blind, which I would read articles n&rsquo; stuff. Leaving early 2015, I managed to produce and present more than 100 episodes of Don&rsquo;t Hold Back, a sort of youth radio show, which arguably I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, but thought would look good on my resume. </p>

		<p>At the same time, I was getting pretty involved with economics and finance in my life. I simply found it fascinating and as a journalism hopeful, I was learning quite a lot about the corruption in finance. As a result I decided to make a Financial YouTube Channel that would explain complex financial issues in simple terms, entitled The Financial Reality. With a lot of sleepless nights, I eventually managed to produce a nine minute video explaining the global debt crisis, which to this day has more than 150,000 views. </p>

		<p>Please don&rsquo;t watch it. It makes me cringe, bad time.  </p>

<div class="year">2012</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>2nd Attempt at YouTube comedy. </li>
	<li>Begun Zero Hedge Daily Round Up podcast. </li>
	<li>Traveled abroad to France and China for an extended period of time. </li>
	<li>Started getting highly political and philosophical. </li>
	<li>Wrote terrible poetry and started experimenting with hard drugs. </li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b8">
		<div class="main">
		<p>Following the release of my global debt crisis video, I had an idea for a podcast, which I thought would be quite successful. I was a Zero Hedge fanatic at the time (before it went crazy) and I thought, what if I created a daily round up of all of Zero Hedge&rsquo;s daily news events? The end result would become six a six minutes finance/comedy daily bulletin that took 3 hours to produce each morning, each Tuesday to Saturday. I would wake up at 7am to make the thing by 5pm NYT. It ended up being highly successful, with more than 55,000 downloads. I was even featured a regular contributor spot on the Zero Hedge Website itself! </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, there was a problem. Despite the success of my podcast, the Zero Hedge crowd hated me. They disliked my humour. They thought I was childish, which I was. It was disheartening to think the community I had embraced thought I was a complete twat. Though there was another greater problem. My depression and mental illness issues was failing to keep up with my ambitions. While my mental health was never particularly great, it was now exacerbated by my media commitments, my desire for fame and the failure of my collaborations. </p>

		<p>I could never be consistent. I would produce media for weeks and then crash and burn into a horrible pit of depression and self-worthlessness. Sometimes I&rsquo;d stop producing shows for weeks at a time. My response, as a result of my upbringing, was to try hard and criticise myself further for not being good enough, you know, how my mother brought me up. I thought my depression was due to a lack of content creation, and so I would come back harder and stronger. </p>

		<p>For The Financial Reality YouTube Channel however, I decided to go down a different route. I decided to mix my two passions together, finance and comedy. The first video I created was called Ben Bernanke Tells Us About money, which I still think is hilarious to this day. In October 2012 I focused solely on creating financial comedy videos until the middle of 2013. </p>

		<p>When I think about it, I also spent a large portion of 2012 writing terrible, somewhat sexual poetry. I also messed around with hard drugs, as a distinctly remember recording a few episodes of the Zero Hedge Daily Round Up while on LSD. I&rsquo;d also travelled to China and France during the middle of the year. Oh, and at some point I decided to give YouTube comedy a second crack. Though thanks to my mental health, barely got past 4 episodes before deducing that I was a worthless piece of crap.</p>

<div class="year">2013</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Started Tumblr blog to find women.</li>
	<li>Continued media with Drudge Report Report and further The Financial Reality YouTube videos. </li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b9">
		<div class="main">
		<p>The last few months of The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up I decided to start a new podcast, The Drudge Report Report, which would assume the same concept of the financial podcast, however target a much bigger media outlet and focus more on comedy. While the popularity grew rapidly, I eventually crashed to a point where I could no longer keep going. My mental illness was destroying me. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe, but I couldn&rsquo;t deal with the guilt and shame of burning out and disappearing into the void. When I was to return, I felt judged and vindicated. The constant criticism made me feel like a complete and utter failure. In addition, I felt like my life WAS a failure. All those failed collaborations. All those friends lost. It seemed like nothing was working out, so I quit. I stopped producing media altogether. Not to mention, I was absolutely abhoring university. </p>

		<p>But rather than give up and let go of all the pain and misdirection, I decided to do something that was arguably worse. Chasing one hopeless ambition for another, I decided to pursue a different goal instead: Women. I don&rsquo;t know what sparked it, but I was determined to get a girlfriend. Hell, I was 20 and I hadn&rsquo;t even kissed a girl yet, so I knew that was something I wanted. </p>

		<p>I had a brilliant thought. What if I used tumblr to pursue women? I mean, a heap of women were on tumblr and because it&rsquo;s not a dating site, it would subtle and thus perfect. Not to mention, the girls on tumblr were usually mentally ill and so we&rsquo;d probably click. Of course, the only it was going to work is if I had a gimmick, so I decided I would handwrite quotes on my blog, in addition to my daily thoughts.</p>

		<p>Initially, it was a bit of a disaster, however after one month and a lot of internet stalking, I finally managed to kiss a girl and within two months, I had my very first girlfriend. Of course, what they don&rsquo;t tell you is that it&rsquo;s a horrible idea to fall in love with someone else who is also mentally ill and suicidal, so naturally the relationship broke down and I sunk into an incredibly depressed. I overdosed on a variety of drugs and ended up in hospital. It was the beginning of my relative downfall.</p>

</ul>

	<div class="boxes b10">
		<div class="main">
		<p>My depression got worse and I become more irrational. I frequently traded one bad crowd for another and I became a highly insecure, emotional wreck. I was smoking weed frequently and taking research chemicals. I didn&rsquo;t value myself and I did anything for women. I mean, what kind of a 21 year old hangings around 16 year old LADS in bad parts of town? Well, the internet is a fantastic place for that thing. Drug dealers, arsonists and delinquents. One kid was 15 and he&rsquo;s was covered in tattoos. Part of me was attracted to the danger, as a journalist at heart. </p>

		<p>Aside from a few near death experiences, the positive was that the insecurity and drugs made for incredibly interesting and brilliant writing, perhaps some of my most fond from a narrative perspective. I continued pursing women on tumblr, eventually finding another partner which didn&rsquo;t work out. Of course, despite becoming an emotional rag doll, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t continue this life of arbitrary mischievous. I pledged to get off tumblr and stop pursing women. Instead, I would focus solely on my mental health and break the cycle of my insecurity. </p>

		<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t easy. I merely traded one addiction for another, soon turning to gambling and pornography to ease my woes. When I left however, there was one girl I still wanted to keep in contact with. She&rsquo;d said she already had a boyfriend and she was incredibly nice, so I thought we could be friends. So we added each other on Facebook. Within 5 minutes, I instantly knew we would be in a relationship (it turns out she was newly single) and we&rsquo;ve been together ever since. </p>

		<p>To celebrate my love for my girlfriend, I wrote her a small book for her Christmas present. It&rsquo;s a few hundred pages, packed full of drawings, cartoons, jokes and pictures. It took ageeees to make.  </p>

	<li>Ozwashroom - Marketing Assistant.</li>
	<li>McLeod Rail - Digital Marketing Specialist.</li>
	<li>ProLearn - Education Consultant.</li>
	<li>Created Perspective Theory, a digital website to assist those with depression.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b11">
		<div class="main">
		<p>I suppose this year was somewhat of a rebound. Graduating at the end of 2014, I began my venture into full-time work. There were a lot of challenges ahead, however I had no choice but to take it one day at a time. Aside from my depression and mental health issues, there were also no journalism/writing jobs available for my experience and given my experience at university, was unsure whether journalism was my thing. </p>

		<p>Thankfully, I had a plan. I was going to develop a writing portfolio during 2015, so that by 2016, I could get the kinds of jobs I wanted. In the meantime, I would work full-time in various positions to sort of get a wide variety of experiences. That writing portfolio was to become Perspective Theory, a website to help those suffering from depression. As I&rsquo;d been actively working on my mental health over the years, I&rsquo;d read enough about perspective and self-awareness to understand how it worked, yet I didn&rsquo;t quite &laquo;&#160;get it&#160;&raquo; . So I thought if I were to write about it, I could better understand how it functioned, as well as develop my own theories and systems. Ultimately, I ended up writing more than 90,000 words (more like 200,000 if you include unpublished drafts). </p>

		<p>As for my working career, I spent two months at a tele-marketing place which was horrendous. Put simply, the turnover was so bad that you would have 30 people would enter the company each week and only two people would stay. I&rsquo;m sure I could write an article on it, however it was soul destroying. It took me another two months before I could garner the courage to find another position, which lead me to discover a Digital Marketing Specialist position I was clearly unqualified for (I distinctly remember the MD shouting at me over my &laquo;&#160;terrible&#160;&raquo; email newsletter). </p>

		<p>Following that venture I managed to score a Marketing Assistant position at Ozwashroom - a small operation which claimed to be a the second largest washroom supplier nationally. Given my sensibilities, I managed to get myself fired after three weeks. </p>

		<p>You see, in preparing for marketing positions, I was required to learn a lot of HTML/CSS and web design. As a result, I virtually spent all my time learning about HTML/CSS, which eventually lead to learning about JavaScript and code. I loved learning code so much that I became obsessed. I would spend all my free time coding, particularly at work. Eventually I got caught out. The funny thing is that they thought I was actually hacking into their system (I won&rsquo;t comment on the intelligence at the company) for trying to steal their &laquo;&#160;SEO&#160;&raquo;, as he put it. </p>

		<p>Now halfway through the year, I realised that I probably had enough experience to secure a proper writing position. Delivering a series of impressive interviews, I ended up as a Content Creator at Expotrade - a global conferencing firm. Actually, my title was immediately upgraded to a PR &amp; Communications Executive, which couldn&rsquo;t sound more amazing. I would write all their collateral, including press releases and news pieces, as well as attend events to interview speakers and ministers. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it only sounds impressive on paper.  </p>

		<p>What a beautiful year. After much struggle I finally managed to get my mental health in order. I effectively cut off all the toxic people in my life, including my own horrible mother. I managed to become mentally stable and it&rsquo;s weird, because I&rsquo;ve never been mentally stable before. I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s inherently better, just more in line with my own goals. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t take my emotions or episodes personality. I very seldom get burnt out and most importantly, I no longer feel riddled in guilt or shame about who I am. My mind is simply calm and focused. It&rsquo;s like my brain has been upgraded or something. The other good thing is that I no longer desire the rebellion from my past. I&rsquo;ve got more than enough interesting stories to tell, in addition to the lifetime supply of cute snapchat selfies I have of myself and with my girlfriend. I&rsquo;ve produced all the offensive comedy I could possibly have ever wanted to produce and I feel as if I have remained authentic to myself in so many different ways. </p>

		<p>One of the big worries about becoming mentally stable is that you think your ambition and character will disappear, however I can ascertain that it only gets strong. To actually have control over yourself, is a completely phenomenal thing. With my mental health in order, I thought it might be a good idea to get back into creating YouTube comedy. I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how it would turn out, however I no longer wanted to live in fear, nor care about what others thought.</p>

		<p>While it started out fine, it slowly evolved into a kind of pure hatred and contempt for humanity. It&rsquo;s hard to describe, however maybe it&rsquo;s was subconscious. The videos no longer made any sense, but maybe that was by design. Maybe the intention was the create something incoherent and ugly? Regardless, it wasn&rsquo;t contributing towards my mental health and so I stopped. Still, it&rsquo;s glad I&rsquo;m something I did. I think expression is an important thing, regardless of what it produces. </p>

		<p>Largely, this year has been spent studying coding and is a process I hope to improve upon for many years to come. Literally, I will code any chance I can.  </p>

		<p> Mainly, I want to focus on my coding </p>

		<p>While I might get back into YouTubing/Podcasting at some point, I feel like I&rsquo;ve achieved enough to last a lifetime and that there are other things that are more urgent in my life. I still write on my medium blog from time to time. </p>
			
		<p>I&rsquo;m also currently in the process of developing a mental health guide, which is roughly 20,000 words through, though I&rsquo;ve probably written 80,000 words over various drafts, trying to conquer this thing. </p>
