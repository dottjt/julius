			<p>
			Under construction, but as I'm using github pages - kinda have to put it online. Sorry! 
			</p>

			<p>
			Rather than present gloss as a primary colour, I thought I’d be interesting to provide an introspective into my life story as a creator. Achievements aside, flashy figures and billion dollar predictions can only hope to avoid the finer context of what we’re actually looking for.
			</p>

			<p> 
			I’ve been writing and creating media since I was 14 years old, and so I would like to think it’s an integral part of who I am. Today, it is an aspect of my personality I would like to share with you. This webpage should take less than five minutes to read, though I’ve also provided summaries for those with a fancy for the headlines.

	<li>Developed my very first blog, Adelaidesucks.</li>
	<li>Slight troublemaker and poor academic.</li>
	<li>Failed at rivaliing a school forum.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b2">
		<div class="main">
		<p>This is where my journey begins. Despite passing the Melbourne High School entrance exam, I couldn&rsquo;t have been more ill-defined for academia. Ranked 278 of 330 students in a hacked list leaked to students, the whole charade was much less interesting than my own misery. Not that I wasn&rsquo;t smart or anything, I just wasn&rsquo;t a particularly dedicated or passionate student. Ultimately, high school was a miserable experience and I had a superiority complex so thick you could cut it with a knife, draining the tar for suitable industrial production. Hate and cynicism were my younger cousins. </p>

		<p>Whilst my peers recognised my talent and humour, having been invited to become part of the jock and a theatre groups, I more-or-less hated everyone and declined any involvement outside of music, which was a parental obligation, rather than a pleasure. Welcome to the life of an Asian teenager. Rather, I would spend each lunchtime in the library, hiding away from the world, feeding off the moisture from my petrification. </p>

		<p>I suppose my first attempt at media began with an online forum some kids had decided to create for our year level. It was very bootleg. Naturally, the response was to create a rival forum, which would obviously be bigger and better in every way. Unfortunately, things didn&rsquo;t turn out as planned. Aside from the fact that no one used it, I was also caught posting a completely defamatory post about the founder of the other forum, which prompted a meeting with the year level coordinator. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been so awkward if my display picture weren&rsquo;t an animated gif of Mario humping Princess Peach as she shouted &laquo;&#160;1-UP&#160;&raquo; . I was suspended within my first few months of academia.</p>

		<p>Following my attempt at treason, I decided to start a blog as I thought it would be an appropriate outlet for my thoughts. As there was kid from Adelaide in our year level, whom everyone felt obliged to hate simply for the fact that he was from Adelaide (the guy from New Zealand got it worse) I decided to call the blog adelaidesucks. Even though I was a terrible writer, with a mild case of dyslexia and who would often could not decipher the difference between past and present tense, it was something I enjoyed greatly. I largely wrote comedy, which was my predominant talent at the time.  </p>
